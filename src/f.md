Insecure Randomness Assessment

Random IDs flagged by Fortify are not security concerns because:

Their purpose is exclusively for HTML DOM manipulation preventing ID collisions in dynamically created elements:
* Element identification
* Component differentiation 
* CSS targeting
* JS interactions

Random IDs are not used for authentication, sessions, encryption, passwords or any other data manipulation. They exist client-side only, are regenerated on page load, not transmitted to servers or stored persistently.

Predictability is irrelevant as no sensitive operations depend on these IDs.
